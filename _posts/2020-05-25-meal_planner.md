# Executive summary
[I want to try the app!](http://martinvari.herokuapp.com)
#### Intro
The goal of the project is to create an app that would help me with shopping. 

The app enables the following:
1. Create recipes and add ingredients
2. Choose meals for the next three days
3. Display a shopping todo list based on the meal plan

#### Problem
It takes me time to remember which ingredients I need for cookign a recipe.
#### Solution
A website that presents me with a todo list when I go shopping for the meals I chose to cook.
